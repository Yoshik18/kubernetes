# CKAD 2025 Study Guide

Hey! üëã These are my study notes for the CKAD exam. I'm still preparing for it, so this is basically my learning journey documented.

## What's This About?

The way I've organized it is pretty straightforward - starting with the basics and working up to the more complex stuff. Each section has:
- My notes on the key concepts (using ai for refinement)
- YAML examples that actually work
- kubectl commands I use all the time
- Some troubleshooting stuff I've picked up
- Practice exercises (some easier than others)

## Sections

### [01. Core Concepts](01.%20core-concepts/)

### [02. Scheduling](02.%20scheduling/)

### [03. Logging](03.%20logging/)

### [04. Application Lifecycle](04.%20app-lifecycle/)

### [05. Security](05.%20security/)

### [06. Storage](06.%20storage/)

### [07. Networking](07.%20networking/)

### [08. Cluster Setup](08.%20cluster-setup/)

### [09. Helm & Kustomize](09.%20helm-kustomize/)

## Tips That Actually Help

### Things I'm Learning
- **Use imperative commands**
- **kubectl explain** for field info
- **Know basic vim**
- **Type quickly**
- **Practice debugging**

## Other Useful Stuff

### Must-Have Links
- [Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/) - You can use this during the exam
- [CKAD Curriculum](https://github.com/cncf/curriculum/blob/master/CKAD_Curriculum_v1.25.pdf) - Official exam topics
- [kubectl Cheat Sheet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/) - Super handy reference

### Practice Exams
- **Killer.sh**
- **KodeKloud**
- **Play with Kubernetes**

## Contributing

If you find mistakes or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue or submit a PR. I'm always trying to improve these notes.

Just make sure to test any examples you add - nothing's worse than code that doesn't work!

## Final Thoughts

Still working on this myself, but from everything I've read, the CKAD exam is challenging but doable with enough practice. It's all about hands-on skills, not memorizing theory.

My plan: practice, practice, practice. Set up a cluster and actually run through scenarios. Just reading about it won't be enough.

Good luck to both of us! üçÄ
